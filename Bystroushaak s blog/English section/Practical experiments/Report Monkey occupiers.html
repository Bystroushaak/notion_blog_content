        <p id="094f5afe-ef7b-4172-ba35-69b7a1d3d59d" class="">In one of my older Czech blog-posts (<a href="http://www.abclinuxu.cz/blog/bystroushaak/2017/10/farani-do-myslenkoveho-dolu-ne-uplne-oddelene-opice">Fárání do myšlenkového dolu Ne-úplně Oddělené Opice</a>, Going down into the though-mine of Not-entirely Separated Monkey), I proposed a theory, that in order to do something intellectual, you have to calm your inner monkey (see <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future</a> for the theory of the inner-monkey).</p>
        <p id="a3cc8f4e-f1cb-4c9c-8f25-1783e1e663f1" class="">You can do this various ways, one of which may be to let it listen to music, or make it occupied by playing with something.</p>
        <p id="01c65896-50f4-4e6e-958a-cbf98d389d2d" class="">This theory was invigorated by the book Mastery, where Robert Greene describes various people who in order to do something had to do specific things to calm their inner monkey:</p>
        <blockquote id="1f0b75e0-6547-46f1-9ed4-7ca606ddf05e" class="">One day, the writer and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe made a curious discovery about the creative process of his friend, the great German writer Friedrich Schiller. Paying a visit to Schiller’s home, he was told that the writer was not in but would return shortly. Goethe decided to wait for him and sat down at Schiller’s writing desk. He began to be assailed by a strange feeling of faintness, his head slowly spinning. If he moved to the window, the sensation went away. Suddenly, he realized that some kind of weird and nauseating smell was emanating from a drawer of the desk. When he opened it he was shocked to see that it was full of rotten apples, some in an extreme state of decay. When Schiller’s wife came into the room, he asked her about the apples and the stench. She told Goethe that she herself filled the drawers with these apples on a regular basis—her husband delighted in the smell and he found he did his most creative work while inhaling the fumes.

Other artists and thinkers have devised similar peculiar aids to their creative process. When doing his deepest thinking about the theory of relativity, Albert Einstein liked to hold on to a rubber ball that he would periodically squeeze in tandem with the straining of his mind. In order to work, the writer Samuel Johnson required that he had on his desk a cat, which he would periodically stroke to make it purr, and a slice of orange. Supposedly only these various sensual cues could properly stimulate him for his work.

These examples are all related to the phenomenon of synesthesia—moments in which the stimulation of one sense provokes another. For instance, we hear a particular sound and it makes us think of a color. Studies have indicated that synesthesia is far more prevalent among artists and high-level thinkers. Some have speculated that synesthesia represents a high degree of interconnectivity in the brain, which also plays a role in intelligence. Creative people do not simply think in words, but use all of their senses, their entire bodies in the process. They find sense cues that stimulate their thoughts on many levels—whether it be the smell of something strong, or the tactile feel of a rubber ball. What this means is that they are more open to alternative ways of thinking, creating, and sensing the world. They allow themselves a broader range of sense experience. You must expand as well your notion of thinking and creativity beyond the confines of words and intellectualizations. Stimulating your brain and senses from all directions will help unlock your natural creativity and help revive your original mind.</blockquote>
