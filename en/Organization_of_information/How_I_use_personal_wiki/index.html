      <p id="fdbe517e-066e-4835-a1cb-3a66dd2b893e" class="">Some time ago, I've given another talk about my personal wiki, and how I use it. At the end, my friend whom I gave this talk suggested, that I should probably write that down, so here it is.</p>
      <p id="fad4508d-c221-43dc-9f32-b3d1e0d36da4" class="">When I talk about personal wiki, people usually right from the beginning have two questions;</p>
      <ol type="1" id="596a1945-b4e0-4441-8408-48763c2e1b6b" class="numbered-list" start="1">
        <li>Why?</li>

      <ol type="1" id="3285e6ea-05dc-47cf-8932-d718002b73cc" class="numbered-list" start="2">
        <li>And then; How?</li>
      </ol>
      <h1 id="2d87c0a4-5855-4a24-8f73-4bd43060e005" class="">Why?</h1>
      <p id="4189b107-519d-40ac-ad33-3fad81a2549e" class="">After more than a decade of use of personal wiki, I've arrived at the idea of treating yourself as a corporation. You are a shareholder, CEO, and also the only worker of your own company.</p>
      <p id="fc022ebe-5fd9-4c92-9b20-882d69cdba34" class="">If you ever worked in some corporation, you've probably used all kinds of internal software; ticket system, documentation system, calendar system, kanban boards, logs of work, galleries, document storage.</p>
      <p id="36a2e0da-5756-4cab-b4df-6b095e781042" class="">All of this may seem like too bureaucratic solution for a problem of self-organizing. Yet, when you think about it, corporations use this software to organize the "matter" which they are composed of; people. These are the tools which give people, that make corporation, shared information bases, communication channels, and more generally speaking, <em>the context</em>.</p>
      <p id="097b27fd-0647-4e4b-a1fd-c4c1e6751c57" class=""><a href="https://sive.rs/book/PragmaticThinking"><em>The context is the king</em></a><em>.</em> So, I use personal wiki a lot for <em>the context</em>, and I am borrowing the functionality from the corporate tools that work for me. I am not organizing people in a corporation, but ideas, thoughts, and facts of my life. But also my external interactions with the digital world.</p>
      <p id="b0b73cb6-5424-42c2-91de-c25bf7dd3716" class="">I forget all the time, especially the details of long-running projects, which can take years to create. So, the <em>"internal documentation"</em> pattern is used a lot in my wiki. But I also use it as a creative tool. When I have something in the wiki, it is relatively easy to work on the thing until it can be published, or until I can derive some kind of value from it.</p>
      <p id="ad929d3b-6298-4d22-8681-7e247a646986" class="">For example, I can have an idea about some kind of programming project. I create a short note, for example something like <em>"octovalve manifold"</em>, which only means something specific to me. Then I later write some points describing it. Weeks later I may expand it, and write a little article, basically a story about the product, which I can use as an inspiration and also as <em>the context</em>, when I get back to the project after a year of working on others. Then I add inspirational pictures, and diagrams. I try to create prototype. Then I convert the page to the kanban board, where I track progress and split the project to components small enough to be able to work on them. I add logs and screenshots and links to documentation of the libraries I am using. And then maybe I publish parts of this process, or maybe they will lead to some other exploration or ideas. In this use case, I use personal wiki as a garden, to grow my ideas.</p>

      <p id="acaea6e0-6289-495c-a68e-6a26d4ab676f" class="">Another big part of my internal wiki is <em>a mirror</em>. When you write about your feelings, about what you want to do, when you track your achievements and datasets, you can sometimes take a step back, and look at it. And you will see yourself. It is like a look in a mirror of your brain. You can see your bad habits, identify your weak points, systematically look for the things you really want to do. It can help you make your desires and half-realized wishes more tangible and help you reach them.</p>
      <p id="696365b2-0b30-4d0b-8a45-1936d82f850b" class="">My wiki is not only part of my external memory, it is much more than that; it is a tool that I shape into a certain form, and it shapes me back. It is a reflection of my brain, that works both ways. And it is also an <em>infosphere manger</em>; a tool I am using to manage a lot of my personal online presence.</p>
      <p id="31996704-4cb1-468c-9db5-9ca39e2df0d3" class="">At this moment, I have more than 1500 subpages in my wiki.</p>
      <h1 id="b9eac17e-e918-4701-b704-9fbcd1b865f4" class="">How?</h1>
      <p id="42cd45df-d897-4919-ad63-8512b4ef9292" class="">I've tried a lot of personal wiki software. Basically, everything I could get my hands on, from the most popular (at the time), to the obscure. You are of course free to use whatever floats your boat, but I would suggest something with rich text editor and with as little bullshit as possible.</p>
      <p id="bbeaa7b1-f62e-442d-a881-4ad4cb977b63" class="">I prefer to use rich text because at the moment when I am trying to write something or be productive, the last thing I want to see and think about is some kind of markup language. I prefer not to see <code>#</code> before every header because I really don't care, and it introduces visual clutter.</p>
      <p id="fad71279-5773-43c1-983f-dfaa8e996f6e" class="">At the moment of writing this blogpost, I am using <a href="http://notion.so">notion.so</a>, which is an online personal wiki.</p>
      <p id="d590fbcc-7a47-4930-91ec-4fd767333d17" class="">I don't like online personal wikis, especially when they are closed and closed-source. I <em>really</em> don't like that. But notion has the best editor and the best UI I've seen so far, so much that the productivity boost it gives me is worth of making some tradeoffs.</p>
      <p id="d6c0115f-16bd-4498-89c5-973d3df6e303" class="">Notion supports markdown in the input text formatting, but it converts it immediately to some kind of internal representation. That means that you can type <code>**bold**</code>, and it will immediately be converted to <strong>bold</strong>. It doesn't require you to know this, and everything has a key shortcut or visual menu.</p>
      <p id="81991540-b064-4664-bc00-c6321a28df8c" class="">Notion is a good starting point because the UI is quite polished. It works for the most of the use cases, and you don't have to set up anything on your computer (but there is a desktop client for Windows & Mac, and also unofficial for Linux). There is also an app for your phone, and REST API.</p>

          I am recommending Notion because one of the hardest things with personal wikis is to start using it for all the things you can use it for. <strong>I strongly recommend pragmatism over idealism.</strong> When you actually develop patterns and create a useful information base, then you can think about switching to something else.

      <h2 id="f819e4b8-78fd-497c-9c3e-a0691743e194" class="">2021 & Logs</h2>
      <p id="2264639a-a289-4e31-a33d-4616e8c0054e" class="">The first section of my wiki is a page, where I write my personal log, a kind of diary, but just in a few short sentences for each day, not like a story. The last section of my wiki is the Logs, where I keep a collection of all of my logs, from the 2007 to 2020. One super long page for each year.</p>
      <p id="7029a21d-ddc3-41e6-bec3-1de11448961b" class="">Every day has a date header, and then several paragraphs. Every so often, I mix it with photos, or maybe scans or uploads of documents. I put new records on top, so the whole year creates this incredibly long log from the end of the year to the beginning.</p>

      </figure>
      <p id="c3c43ac1-9bb5-425f-96e2-ec02a1a4301f" class="">Every day, I just duplicate the header (<code>CTRL+d</code>), then increase the date via the date picker and write a few paragraphs, insert some picture from that day, some scanned document or something relevant.</p>
      <p id="7876155e-1d5a-42f1-abc8-b0e0d16ced1d" class="">Nothing really interesting to see here, the important thing is to learn to do this consistently. It is really useful to be able to look into your past.</p>

      <p id="1f5713fb-809e-465c-b78d-bf0873cdcb75" class="">This is one of the more complex categories, which contains anything I want to do in the future. The top-level page contains all the following subpages and kanban boards as one long linear view.</p>
      <h3 id="c938bfbd-acfd-45f5-9681-0af20fef6e67" class="">Kanban TODO</h3>
      <p id="08491d7e-a145-4ec0-be73-8a8526dac1c4" class="">This may seem trivial, or even obvious. Yet, this category is the most important category in the whole blog. The point is not just TODO in nice kanban table. I use this category as an input point for everything.</p>
      <p id="6ae89d59-3894-44da-a67b-5d99bd33b0a1" class="">New idea? Put it in the TODO. I am falling a sleep, but suddenly remember I want to do something? <em>I'll put it in the TODO, using the mobile app</em>. I would like to do something, some day in the future, but I know that I won't probably ever do it? <em>I'll put it in the TODO</em>. I see an interesting link, or video I would like to watch? You guess it; <em>I'll put it in the TODO</em>.</p>
      <p id="dd812be8-7010-4d92-a2af-b2b8bf03f9c3" class="">The goal is to have one <em>input space</em> for everything, no matter how small or big. The moment you have the idea, put it there. You'll sort it later, move it to different category, different TODO, or whatever.</p>
      <p id="0b2cc118-42a4-4a14-a030-07439bc7525b" class="">This category really works in three different modes:</p>

      <p id="e98a17d6-a65d-4a98-8aff-343858b1eb9c" class="">This one is harder to explain. It was inspired by a tool used in my first job, where I worked as a service-desk operator. The tool was connected with a ticketing system, and it would show a list of tickets. You could open the ticket, but most importantly, you could <em>postpone</em> the ticket into the future, so it would disappear and show itself again several days later. In service-desk, this was used for important things, so that people don't forget them.</p>

      <h2 id="869fd245-0091-47af-93e3-f6f93797b76f" class="">Offline hosting</h2>
      <p id="b749ee7c-cdf5-4755-8c51-8cedffb31ccb" class="">Again, specific problem of notion, as it is an online wiki.</p>
      <p id="846f9d13-9ef1-4e93-984b-83f65821cdd2" class="">I've used offline wikis before, but all of them were lacking features I am now used to.</p>
      <h2 id="f3a14d6b-12b2-48b3-aa9c-676aeeaa2259" class="">Interactivity</h2>
      <p id="d8705871-ac20-475e-8251-652e757c3089" class="">At some point, your wiki grows into such complexity, that it would be really nice to make it into more than a wiki. To make it interact with outside world.</p>
      <p id="99533a13-29c4-4f9e-ab1e-b6f1ee32b2c8" class="">Notion has API, which is nice I guess, but that's not what I am talking about. It also has templates, which you can instantiate with a click on a button, which is the step in the right idea, but still pretty weak.</p>
      <p id="54b1843a-93c0-4649-8fe5-9a889eda1ba6" class="">What I would like is the ability to:</p>
      <ol type="1" id="3a7b2b22-5c57-4e17-b151-9f5a0e22bb6d" class="numbered-list" start="1">
        <li>Create your own custom widgets.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol type="1" id="2ca9237e-a4ae-4230-b476-28f8e3bb6b4d" class="numbered-list" start="2">
        <li>Ability to script actions. Not just things that happen in your wiki, but even on your computer.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="3d2962cd-c738-457a-8313-b2ff59ada02d" class="">Data storage</h2>
      <p id="055839df-431c-4700-9811-c0f2038ce2dc" class="">At some point, it would make perfect sense to store everything in your wiki. Results from script runs, objects and so on.</p>
      <p id="03a7f574-fc61-4922-b66d-2fb83a3236e5" class="">I won't go into details here, but expect a blogpost about this some time later.</p>
      <h2 id="292b10bf-0f8d-4b87-a1a5-ccac2e22bd94" class="">Document storage</h2>
      <p id="734871cc-90d1-4229-a145-a6e603ee74af" class="">While you can store documents (PDF, DOC) in notion, you can't work with them. You can't even see them directly, just a link to the stored file.</p>
      <p id="1e8e2448-93bd-4e8d-97f7-4369abec3e0b" class="">It would be nice to have a special document storage section, where you could work with your documents, tag them, search in them and so on.</p>
