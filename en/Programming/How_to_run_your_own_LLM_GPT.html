      <p id="fbfba17f-01a8-438a-980a-cba47d85f258" class="">In order for a neural network to predict the next token over the gigantic dataset it was trained on, it must create rich internal representations. These include not only all possible human languages but also knowledge, relationships, and patterns.</p>
      <p id="e2e9ad15-0d8c-4633-88e0-dbbb11b016e6" class="">This is sometimes referred to as <em>"compression"</em> because the network is, the way it is trained on a large amount of data, forced to create these representations over a limited set of weights and neurons. In theory, it could store billions of examples in the style of a <em>"Chinese room,"</em> where it simply saves <em>"question"</em> - <em>"answer"</em> (the beginning of the completed text—the following token). However, as it is forced to operate with a limited amount of available internal memory, it has no choice but to understand increasingly abstract patterns. Somehow, it internally represents this as <em>"knowledge"</em> and <em>"understanding."</em></p>

      <p id="991b5db5-e5fe-46d9-b2df-91bf8e51f350" class="">This pattern recognition occurs at the language level (syntax and grammar), the <em>word embeddings</em> level (meaning of words and how they relate), and at a much more abstract level (how things being discussed function and how they relate).</p>
      <p id="eec631e8-d1e0-4c21-bf0f-098b039fe5f9" class="">Thus, it does not work by simply completing conversations based on what it has seen before. That's why these models are capable of translating between languages better than anything else that has existed so far – because they genuinely understand the context of what is being discussed.</p>
      <p id="b12df9d7-ded2-472e-acc2-e8deee8ce8f5" class="">If the model were to complete based solely on what it has already seen, it would not be able to translate unless it had previously seen the exact sentence or ideally the entire paragraph.</p>
      <p id="055c4a60-0173-4291-ab26-0f5cf539dcb6" class="">As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goOa0biX6Tc">Ilya Sutskever says</a>, imagine that during training, it completes a detective novel's text where the murderer is revealed only on the last page of the book filled with various investigations. For the network to correctly complete the murderer's name when the detective mentions it in the text, it must <em>understand</em> all possible connections, the entire investigation, different pieces of evidence, and so on.</p>
      <h2 id="09bb920b-1fb1-4033-9e1b-46d4b7b4f10d" class="">Simulators</h2>
      <p id="5171645f-6f5d-42f1-ba1e-f4d55c5545cd" class="">Before the chat mode was introduced, the results, for example with GPT-3, were somewhat unsatisfactory. Sure, it did something, but after the initial surprise, it was not absolutely mind-blowing, and it often went in an entirely different direction than desired. Overall, it appeared quite limited.</p>
      <p id="ce3d6fb6-496f-49a9-ae65-b00230d8e79f" class="">As many people have observed, the performance dramatically depended on the prompt given to the AI. Sometimes it couldn't explain or do anything. Other times, it succeeded when told to pretend to be Sherlock Holmes.</p>
      <p id="56577679-ea74-418e-ae22-31c45a90859b" class="">This is essentially due to the way it was trained and that it is a text completer. It simply tends to complete. In order to make it complete intelligently and usefully, it is necessary to set the context so that it <em>completes</em> the story of a smart and useful character – like Sherlock Holmes. Just as it would be in the training data. Smart behavior in stories about smart people. If one let it complete something without proper context, the results were quite random.</p>

      <h2 id="191a7bc7-eec2-46c9-b331-eebca9e9342c" class="">Chat</h2>
      <p id="4c98d9e6-8b6b-485e-a0a1-b3ebc9dc96ab" class="">With this comes the surprisingly high utility of chat. Chat is not a radically new feature, but rather a way in which auto-completion is being utilized. For example, in <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>, we can find a file <code>chat-with-bob.txt</code> in the <code>prompts/</code> subfolder. It contains the following content:</p>
      <pre id="b65fa331-27a8-45b6-a698-cdf395834549" class="code code-wrap"><code>Transcript of a dialog, where the User interacts with an Assistant named Bob. Bob is helpful, kind, honest, good at writing, and never fails to answer the User's requests immediately and with precision.

User: Hello, Bob.
Bob: Hello. How may I help you today?
User: Please tell me the largest city in Europe.
Bob: Sure. The largest city in Europe is Moscow, the capital of Russia.
User:</code></pre>
      <p id="d10054c8-5a64-49fe-929d-acb3d69317ff" class="">The entire <em>chat mode</em> works in a very trivial way – first, it feeds the AI assistant's conversation transcript to the network for completion, starting with a <em>prompt</em>, followed by a sample <em>format</em> (question, answer). Once the program encounters the <code>User:</code> pattern in the output, it uses simple pattern matching:</p>
      <pre id="437d896c-f439-47ef-bab8-8cbcaee53f9b" class="code code-wrap"><code>-r PROMPT, --reverse-prompt PROMPT
     run in interactive mode and poll user input upon seeing PROMPT (can be
     specified more than once for multiple prompts).</code></pre>
      <p id="0d87d069-b26c-450d-9e93-98993b54a926" class="">If it finds a string specified in this parameter, it loads a bit of data from the user, adds it to the original document, and continues completing. This creates the entire illusion of chat, even though the model is still just completing the "transcript" of a conversation between a human and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p id="1a0abc1a-ea7c-45b4-9f4a-357d7c359124" class="">When you look at the <em>prompt</em>, it provides the context of the simulator – a transcript of a conversation with a helpful assistant, which has a <em>format</em> of alternating questions and answers. The model, therefore, behaves usefully and helpfully because it completes the story of what it would look like if it were being useful and helpful.</p>
      <p id="6ae832a6-97c9-4ed3-a565-5d3f94a0ef9d" class="">This also means that when you chat with the AI using ChatGPT, you don't have access to the context. However, if you go to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground">playground</a>, you can set the <em>prompt</em> to some extent (I write <em>to some extent</em> because, in my opinion, OpenAI still appends its <em>prompt</em>):</p>

This way, it is possible to overcome some of the model's shortcomings, such as short-term memory or issues with long-term planning.</p>

This involves extending the original functioning model with an additional layer that indicates the <em>suitability</em> of the response, and then it learns <em>acceptable behavior</em> from various conversation examples.

Shoggoth must simulate to complete text. When it doesn't understand, in most cases, it falls out of character and doesn't know what role to pretend. You must provide the context for it. Not the context of the conversation, but what it is supposed to be, like what should it lead the conversation. Meh.</p>

      <p id="edf849ea-2917-444e-8317-be643efe155b" class="">Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that when you take these <em>human alignment</em> data and put them into significantly smaller models, you can achieve performance levels slightly below GPT-3 in various benchmarks. GPT-3 is 175B, GPT-4 is reportedly 6x larger, but I didn't find the numbers; someone claims it has 10x more parameters. The "B" in the description stands for the English <em>billion</em> (parameters).</p>

      <p id="b0626b5c-4e97-4218-8ae8-f7d64e793f46" class="">Facebook (Meta AI, ehm) created a set of relatively small <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/"><em>llama</em></a> models 7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B, which they trained in a standard way. Then they more or less made it all public. Originally, they probably intended to make it entirely public, but in the backlash from the public discussing the abuse of GPT-4, they decided to give it only to other <em>researchers (.edu mail is a big plus)</em> after filling out a form. Of course, the obvious happened, and the models are being distributed everywhere possible (torrent, wink wink).</p>
      <p id="d1a0abc8-cb00-4925-9cd0-9ed73fc07dde" class="">People from Stanford took the smallest <em>llama</em> 7B model and used <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10560.pdf">self-instruct</a> fine-tuning on it, creating <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html">Alpaca</a>.</p>

So, it's a case of <em>"one model trains another model on good and bad"</em>.

So, to get it up and running, one needed to find <em>llama</em> somewhere. Everyone patted themselves on the back for being responsible and preventing the spread of spam and disinformation. This lasted until about the second day, when someone combined it and posted it on the internet.</p>

        <li>In the future, I want to script the translation of my blog into various languages. Languages have become less important, so why not automatically translate it into most major ones for a few dollars? It already has better quality than cheap human translators (150 CZK / standard page) from various marketplaces, and the price will be in the order of dolars per article. Fun fact: english version of this blogpost was translated by GPT, and it cost me $7. This is less than what I would have to pay for the translation of one standard page (1800 characters) and 1/24 of the costs.

      <p id="94ef9439-48e1-42f9-aa44-207ec456db32" class="">Try training smaller models on my own datasets. Maybe using AWS EC2 instead of buying a new GPU for 50k CZK, but we'll see. Most consumer GPUs still have too little VRAM.</p>
      <p id="cbd1c2c4-7fdf-4f4f-9598-680b8a69b447" class="">Try creating my own embeddings and vector databases and see how well it works to search through OpenAI. People are using it, and I want to find out how useful it is and maybe apply it to everything I have on my PC.</p>
      <p id="6238fb84-4c8b-46f2-89d7-75f174ca1607" class="">Try to put GPT4 into various tools, integrate it into various APIs, and improve its usefulness. I'm not concerned about the usefulness of the model – it's fantastic already, but I'm tired of constantly writing the same prompts or copying pieces of code back and forth awkwardly. Ideally, integrate it better into the system (right-click on file, select "conversation with GPT", open my custom GUI where I handle the data with the chatbot).</p>
      <h2 id="0380b45c-c149-4f91-acfd-e818ea908d16" class="">Trends and the future</h2>
      <p id="d0e79403-78de-4ca4-967a-f2b1f6792f6a" class="">The obvious trends are larger models and models with larger context windows. Personally, I haven't yet read up on what actually limits this, but the 8k context (how many tokens the model can perceive) in GPT4 makes a brutal difference compared to 1/2k in GPT3. And there is even a 32k version, just with a slower rollout.</p>
      <p id="c12fbe78-e57b-49cb-a2c9-8865e779864d" class="">In 2020, I wrote in an article (<a href="../../cz/Predstaveni/GPT-3.html" title="GPT-3">GPT-3</a>):</p>

        I think with the opening of the API, a new position of "helmsman" of the output will emerge. A kind of specialization of people who will offer the generation of "pre-prepared" settings and parameters to solve specific problems.

      <p id="c5046f1e-a142-40ef-b4de-8022206c2966" class="">Well, this already exists as a job position, and it's called <em>“prompt engineering”</em>. Cool. From what I've seen, there is a growing business in implementing AI into all sorts of things. Often quite vaporware, but for example, searching through <em>embeddings</em>, it looked quite impressive.</p>
      <p id="fdedf814-a75d-4078-b046-1030ca6c6d5b" class="">The current biggest problem with all models is their isolation, limited context, and inability to learn. So in the future:</p>

        <li>They will not be isolated – they will have access to tools, and it will be easy to put your own data into them. I see this as a big pain point; ideally, I would like to have it running locally and across everything. <em>“Find the link my friend sent on IRC yesterday”</em>. <em>“A few years ago, I wrote a script that outputs the structure of HTML websites, find it among hundreds of others”</em>. <em>“Write a script for the action I just did and assign a keyboard shortcut”</em>. <em>“Take the data I see on the screen now and do this and that with it”</em>. Siri and Alexa, which are not completely stupid and useless. Integration with various APIs is already in beta, and it reportedly works great.</li>

        <li>Of course, the models will learn and will have different forms of long-term memory, whether it's retraining or things like <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">pinecone</a> and other embedding storages. They will also have integrated reflection, the ability to see into their own reasoning and explain tokenization, how data is stored, and so on. This is possible to find out today, but it's brutally complex and cumbersome.

      </ol>
      <p id="c0205361-2861-4145-a444-96002ba0bb81" class="">Gradually, they will be capable of doing absolutely everything. They mostly are now, just in their infancy, alignment sometimes doesn't work, and occasionally, it takes more effort to explain to the model than to do it manually.

      <h2 id="0cd3e9a0-6288-4067-b7b8-0d42b0466701" class="">AGI</h2>
      <p id="ccbfcf17-9ee1-4ea9-96c1-50133139296c" class="">And the end is near. Not of humanity, but of the blog. So, about AGI:</p>
      <p id="f91b3db3-4b7c-4cab-8ec6-91247e4f588b" class="">In my opinion, this will directly lead to AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, an AI that is capable of <em>everything</em> intellectual, on average, as well as or better than a <em>human</em> (which does not mean it will <em>always</em> do <em>everything</em> better than <em>everyone</em> else).</p>
      <p id="b3743504-a121-4b27-addf-6d10cae22287" class="">It's not that it's completely here, but now it's just a matter of trying different approaches, improving scalability, and so on. After a hundred years when no one had any idea how to do it, and scientists couldn't even agree on the definition of "intelligence," it's finally coming. It's just still somewhat dumb.</p>
      <p id="2ef2c3d7-9a76-4390-ac59-b7fc3ccfe65f" class="">This is like the first airplane. It flies, hooray. But mainly, it shows the <em>way</em>, that <em>it's possible</em>, and probably even <em>how</em>. Now it's just a matter of working on it for a while, with good old iterative development.</p>
      <p id="5c0adda5-70fb-4a0f-8128-256c92a71a32" class="">What caught my interest were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop">strange loops</a> that people have been doing with GPT lately. A beautiful example is <a href="https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT">Auto-GPT: An Autonomous GPT-4 Experiment</a>. It essentially takes your request, the model first thinks about how to do it, and then interacts with various tools on the web and disk, and so on. When something is too big (exceeding the context window), it launches additional models that it instructs. During this process, it stores various pieces of information on the disk, which it then reads back to instruct itself. In theory, it is capable of fulfilling quite high-level goals, but in practice, it is still in its infancy and often gets lost.</p>
      <p id="8617273b-9ea7-4f7f-be41-842121073def" class="">Currently, it is quite unusable, but overall, it is starting to simulate more complex thought processes quite well. It reminded me a lot of my old blog post <a href="../../cz/Crypto/Entity.html" title="Entity">Entity</a>, where I described a system that is not intelligent but rents intelligence from people to improve itself. And this can basically delegate intelligence in a similar way, just on itself.</p>
