      <p id="33d9d3ea-4fea-401b-887f-caa2002e930e" class="">Some time ago, I've come across a <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/srk21//research/papers/kell13operating.pdf">contemplation</a> on the topic of necessity of operating systems. I've been doing sort of <em>"research"</em> about this for almost two years, so I've decided to write up central thoughts along with links to some relevant sources of information on this topic.</p>
      <h2 id="fe0def4e-ab60-4a8c-b403-fd0539e59023" class="">Be aware</h2>

      <p id="b472cd22-edfc-4d29-b214-c310f6eb4ef3" class="">I would like to declare that I am talking about myself. When I write that something is <em>"necessary"</em>, <em>"possible"</em>, or <em>"viable"</em>, what I mean is that it's <em>"necessary for me"</em>, <em>"possible for me"</em>, or <em>"viable for me"</em>.</p>
      <p id="4c4a0318-67c9-4db4-9835-f0a581c3367f" class="">I've seen too many discussion drama caused by reading between lines and by applying reader's presuppositions and opinions on the topic of author's character. I know that this notice probably wouldn't help, but please, try to read and think about presented ideas with open mind.</p>

Remember the declaration presented in previous paragraphs. I am not talking about you, I don't have the need or urge to press something on you, break your workflow or slander your system. Take it as my strangeness or maybe a possible direction of research. Please, don't apply it to yourself.</p>

      <h1 id="8a9e8c05-d2c6-47d7-bae8-50d0868abd45" class="">Why?</h1>
      <p id="9e68b56a-393a-4cc3-bd6e-515d106486f5" class="">In recent years, I've worked for several companies that make software. In some cases, I was a part of bigger teams, in other cases, I started with a few other programmers from scratch. I was often involved in designing the system's architecture, if I wasn't the one creating it from the beginning.</p>
      <p id="c7d6a71d-2dc3-42b9-a839-8f53b8796e5c" class="">I work as a <em>"backend programmer"</em>. My job description is to create systems which read, process and store all kinds of data, parse all kinds of formats, call all kinds of programs and interact with other systems and devices.</p>
      <p id="3e4c9360-a6fb-401e-adb3-6800a09d6eeb" class="">In <em>the Czech National Library</em>, I was a part of a three-man team where I was working on a system for processing electronic publications. I wrote almost whole backend code, from data storage to communication with existing library systems; Aleph, Kramerius, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation">LTP</a> (Long Time Preservation). For storage, we were using ext4/CentOS and object storage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope_Object_Database">ZODB</a> forced by <a href="https://plone.org/">Plone</a> frontend. For the communication, system used all kinds of protocols, from REST and upload of XML files to FTP, to zipping files with generated XML manifest and uploading them to smb. Backend microservices and frontend used RabbitMQ.</p>
      <p id="a5a8a3cb-aad7-48d0-b343-9182ddcbd6c0" class="">In another company, which shall not be named, I worked on a system for DDoS protection. I can't talk about specific details because of the NDA I've signed but you could get all kinds of buzzwords from the job ads from that time; Linux, Python, SQL and NoSQL databases, all kinds of existing opensource software and RabbitMQ for communication. Most of the communication backend was written by me.</p>
      <p id="18d0fc7d-ea16-4d2a-a5e9-345eb6b14e62" class="">I also worked on the backend for the <em>Nubium development</em>, a company which operates probably the biggest Czech file hosting website <em>uloz.to</em>. I've refactored and partially designed pieces of software that handle the storage and redistribution of files across different servers, and also software that handles processing of used data. Icons with thumbnails that show in preview of compressed and video files is one example of the stuff I've done there, among a good deal of other stuff you can't see directly.</p>
      <p id="c293bcd2-0cac-4083-ac4e-9fd0c83eb695" class="">I also did websites and REST services for several other companies and I've touched more exotic stuff as well. For example, I was a part of a three-man team working on a project of a video recognition system that detected objects in live video feeds from all kinds of public tunnels (Metro, road tunnels). There, I've learned a lot from the machine learning optimization tasks I was solving, from the low-level image processing and from the architecture of the whole backend code.</p>
      <p id="5bf6575c-119c-43d2-9a8d-2d913fdde45c" class="">I'm telling you this not only to establish my credibility, but also because I've seen the same pattern everywhere I worked; independently created, but approximately similar piece of software, which has naturally grown from several requirements:</p>
      <ul id="4533f765-86fb-4a6b-877e-781b47aa799f" class="bulleted-list">
        <li>Reliable storage of a large number of small files (millions or billions of files, from megabytes to gigabytes per file), or a smaller number of large files (terabytes per file).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="44a818de-48c9-4e9f-85a0-26a4741d2a0b" class="bulleted-list">
        <li>Reading and storage of configuration in some kind of structured format (INI, JSON, XML, YAML, ..).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="248f57ae-050d-4ce2-bfb1-520d5d9748d9" class="bulleted-list">
        <li>Structured communication between internal services, but also with external programs.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="a9761c69-e244-44be-bb8b-04b562066c33" class="bulleted-list">
        <li>Distributed architecture with multiple physical machines, which allows good scaling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="92c7a15e-a44c-4bd7-8901-e836182691cf" class="">If you are a programmer, you probably know what I am getting to. If many programmers create the same pattern on top of some programming library, it is not a mistake of those people, but a mistake in the design of the library.</p>
      <p id="0d8d0547-6269-4834-9aaf-30c00a98bc82" class="">As I was thinking about it, I've realized that <em>architecture</em> of the operating system itself is wrong for this kind of job. The stuff it offers and the stuff it allows us to do, is not what we want and expect. Especially not from the <em>"programmer's user interface"</em> point of view, which is the stuff I often work with as a programmer.</p>
      <h1 id="5c31cfe1-8940-4831-827f-f69d7353fca1" class="">Operating system</h1>
      <p id="b013c4cb-0dfe-42e9-8f45-553343f976f5" class="">When I was a kid, I thought I knew what an operating system is; <em>Windows</em>, that's for sure! That's the stuff everyone has on their computer; there is a button with "Start" on it in the left bottom corner, and if you start a computer and only black screen comes on, you'll have to type <code>win</code> to make it appear.</p>
      <p id="b40aaaef-4a61-40fd-9068-74cdb0eaddbf" class="">High school taught me a definition, by which the operating system is <em>"an equipment in form of a program, which makes the input-output devices of the computer available"</em>.</p>
      <p id="e8728202-db54-457a-80d3-7dd708460bb0" class="">Later, I've found out that there are all kinds of operating systems, and almost all of them do the same stuff; they create ± united abstraction on top of the hardware, allow running different kinds of programs, offer more or less advanced filesystem and networking, and also handle memory and multitasking and user permissions.</p>
      <p id="5823cec6-41b5-4911-a24b-0072732da36a" class="">Today, operating system is for most of the people that thing which they use to run browser where they watch <em>youtubes</em> and <em>facebooks</em> and also send messages to others. Sometimes, it can run games and work with all kinds of hardware, from CD-ROM to keyboard.</p>
      <p id="04889043-52cd-4563-802f-aa6d5825bf88" class="">For advanced users, OS is a specific form of a database and API, which allows them to run programs and also provides standardized mechanism to different operations, such as, for example, printing a character on the screen, storing something under a name in the permanent storage, creating connection over the Internet, and so on.</p>
      <p id="f262bfca-37f0-4759-b523-6c5100ea7cb4" class="">We usually tend to think about the OS as about something that is given and more or less changeless, something that we pick from the Holy Trinity (Windows, Mac, Linux), around which crouches a range of small (0.03%) alternatives (*BSD, Plan9, BeOS,..).</p>
      <p id="46c66092-f8c6-4e1b-acde-55d671b8aad7" class="">For some reason, almost all used operating systems are, with a few exceptions, almost the same. I would like to explore whether that is really desired property or an artifact of historical development.</p>
      <h2 id="dbc8c034-e82f-4e75-882a-8bd0658af95e" class="">Short history of operating systems</h2>
      <p id="bec3edba-4618-46fe-ad76-516604b6716d" class="">First computers didn't have operating systems and were generally everything but user friendly. The only way to program them was by directly changing hardware switches.</p>
      <p id="848baa9c-d490-4db8-9e15-4171be245e37" class="">Then, computers programmed by punch cards and tape came. In order to use them, operators still had to <a href="https://youtu.be/XV-7J5y1TQc?t=242">manually enter the bootloader</a> directly into the memory to tell the computer how to use the punch tape hardware. But the rest of the work was done by a key.</p>
      <p id="3157141e-72de-44cd-b396-a69a10216ba1" class="">System worked on so called "batches". A programmer delivered a medium with data and a program to work on this data, a system operator then loaded the given "batch" to the computer and run the program. When the program finished, he returned results or error message to the programmer.</p>
      <p id="429f26b1-3d2f-4426-b260-3112f1c118d3" class="">Since the whole process required quite a lot of manual work, it was only natural that parts of the whole process were automated in form of tools and libraries with useful functions; for example, a loader which is loaded automatically when the computer starts and allows to load programmer's program only by pressing a specific button. Or <em>subroutines</em> which print content of the memory in case of an error. This bundles of tools were called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_monitor"><em>monitors</em></a>.</p>
      <p id="feb1a49f-119d-4ac5-a11f-bfd7cf8193c7" class="">As computers at that time were really, really expensive, there was a pressure to share them amongst multiple users at the same time. This gave birth to the first <em>operating systems</em> which merged functionality of the <em>monitors</em> with support for running multiple programs at once together, and also added user management and concurrent user sessions.</p>
      <p id="b1866601-83c6-4fe8-b2f8-42c7063db0bc" class="">Increasingly complex hardware and complexity of the direct control put pressure on the universality and reuse of the code across different machines and their versions. Operating systems began to support standard devices. It was no longer necessary to give specific address of memory on the disc drive, you could just store the data under some name, and later, also in the directory. First file systems were born. With the support of concurrent access of multiple users, it was also quite obvious that it is necessary to separate their processes and programs, so that they can't read and overwrite each other's data. This gave rise to memory allocators, virtual memory and to multitasking as we know it.</p>
      <p id="f5112518-c20f-441c-b719-052997322421" class="">Operating systems became a layer which stands between the user, who was no longer required to become a programmer, and the hardware. They provide standardized ways to store data, print out characters, handle keyboard input, printing on printer and running batches or programs.</p>
      <p id="32106d0b-c756-42cb-8868-c9e3d502b1a0" class="">Later on, also graphical interface and networking was added. Personal computers offered plenty of devices, all of which had to be supported by the operating system. Except for a few exceptions, it was all iterative development which didn't bring anything new.

Every day, vast amounts of CPU cycles are unnecessarily wasted on conversion of <em>raw</em> bytes to structures and then back. And every program does that differently, sometimes even in different versions of that program. Considerable part of my time as a programmer is spent by parsing and converting the data, which, if it had a structure, would be editable by simple transformation. Take a part of the tree here and move it here. Add this to this part of the graph, remove something else here.</p>

The absurdity is even more evident when we realize that this is not just the Lego, but everything. Want to send a glass bottle? Break it into tiny sand pieces and tell the recipient that he has to make the bottle himself. I understand that in the end, you always have to send raw bytes on some level, just as you have to send Lego cubes eventually. But why don't you send them already in form of the castle?</p>

      <p id="cd8f4521-c989-4bce-8d83-cb2c2f235650" class="">If you call the program from some kind of a "command line", that is some kind of a shell, like bash, then you also get a mixture of the shell scripting language and its ways of defining strings, variables and only god knows what else (I can think of escape sequences, reserved names of functions, eval sequences using some random characters like <code>`</code>, wildcard characters, <code>--</code> for stopping the evaluation of wild cards, and so on). This is just one gigantic mess where everyone uses whatever he thinks is nice and parses it without any internal consistence or logic, just because he can.</p>

For example, your <a href="https://thraxil.org/users/anders/posts/2008/03/13/Subprocess-Hanging-PIPE-is-your-enemy/">buffer stops responding</a> for larger outputs. Or, the program reacts differently when run in an interactive mode, then in non-interactive, and there is no way of forcing it behave correctly. Or, it puts random escapes sequences and <code>tty</code> formatting to the output, but only <em>sometimes</em>. And, how do you actually transfer <strong>structured data</strong> to the program and from it?</p>
      <p id="e6facb40-d848-4ce7-902f-9664f2eba3a3" class="">I just don't get this mess. The command line parameters are usually just a list or a dictionary with nested structures.

But, because of the <em>missing structure,</em> they are just a one-dimensional dictionary with keys and values as strings. In D, they would be declared as <code>string [string] env;</code>. This is often not enough because you need to transfer nested or more complicated structures than just simple strings. So, you are forced to use serialization.</p>

This usually takes form of some kind of a configuration file. Do you know where the file is located? In Linux, it is customary to place them in <code>/etc</code>, but they can also be in your <code>$HOME</code>, or in <code>$HOME/.config</code>, or in a random dot subfolder (like <code>$HOME/.thunderbird/</code>).</p>
      <p id="f49906b1-035e-4e51-a8cf-73d3220bafaa" class="">And, what about the format? I think you can guess it. It can be literally anything anyone ever thought of.

      <p id="46a713bd-136b-4fc0-8e66-ccec04968936" class="">There is a joke that the complexity of each configuration file format increases with time, until it resembles a poorly implemented half of the lisp.

      <ol id="26ea84f3-e320-4bb4-9ade-ab8207cbd9d4" class="numbered-list" start="1">
        <li>Structured logging. That is, to store the logs in a format that is actually parse-able and you can query it and get, for example, just logs for a given time period, or with a given log level.</li>

      <ol id="7677502f-b823-4e04-aa23-ba1869c9046a" class="numbered-list" start="2">

      <ol id="d523d006-2413-4eca-8dd8-b31f0d03fc95" class="numbered-list" start="1">
        <li>The structure of the logs is random. Virtually, everyone uses some more or less parse-able format but its shape and structure is almost always different. It is rarely defined how multiline log messages are stored and escaped. Parsing takes place largely through regexps and is practically always fragile and breakable. I often proudly show my colleagues how easy it is to break their log structure by circumventing their regexps. Then, I try to convince them to use something unbreakable by design, but only sometimes they really do so.</li>

      <ol id="7cd4bd7a-8009-41f6-9d03-10d983137a96" class="numbered-list" start="2">
        <li>Parallel logging is usually solved by some kind of a separate logging server. File system, unlike almost all other databases, can't usually guarantee atomic changes, and usually also nothing like triggers or transactions. If this logging server fails, logs are lost.</li>

      <ol id="90bbea57-e15f-4a24-b856-6b1748b97a90" class="numbered-list" start="3">
        <li>Log rotation is also often handled by an external application and practically always a matter of a periodically triggered cron job. I have not yet seen a clever logging platform that would be able to log logs when it's probable that there won't be soon any space left on the storage device. I've seen quite a few production services that were stopped by this trivial problem. Another problem is that applications typically keep the log file open, and if the file is "rotated" under their hands without a warning, it will break the whole thing. This is solved completely non-elegantly by sending signals to the applications, which they must be able to respond to asynchronously. I've recently laughed so badly when my colleague wanted to disable file logs and to only to stdout, so he changed the path of the log file to <code>/dev/null</code>. All of this worked beautifully until the Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#rotatingfilehandler"><code>RotatingFileHandler</code></a> decided to rotate the file and the whole application crashed.

        <li>As for the delivery mechanism, some applications simply open the file and log into it. Others send data to UDP (syslog). Others send JSON messages to Sentry. It is done in whatever way which is currently popular and which comes to someone's mind.</li>
      </ol>
      <p id="42133631-6834-4beb-a76d-f821e01e6dc0" class="">Logging seems to me as a beautiful example which practically everybody is forced to solve and which the operating system doesn't support in its full complexity.

      <p id="9a571078-372c-4ea0-b105-d0615d59ce8b" class="">Messages are objects. They have an emit timestamp, short description and usually also a log level (in python typically <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>WARNING</code> and <code>ERROR</code>). When you work with logs, you almost never want to work with a text. For example, you want to limit the date range, how do you do it when everything you've got is a text? Or, log level - if you want all <code>ERROR</code> messages, you don't want to <code>grep</code> it in text, because the word "ERROR" can be used in the body of the message in different contexts. For example, "NO_ERROR".</p>
      <p id="7867c2ba-a81b-4550-a785-abef0cce4a2f" class="">The application which is used for logging should receive messages and store them in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)">queue data structure</a>. This would guarantee never running out of a disk space. Older messages could be automatically compressed, but this should be transparent to users - if they want to search for compressed messages, they should not even know about it.</p>
      <p id="14019e13-24d7-478b-9bc4-3ee92ad03d8f" class="">There shouldn't be fifty ways of how to use logging - it should be a matter for the user to instantiate a system logger and then use it, after a brief configuration where he chooses a rotation policy. Then, it just logs by standard message sending, either locally or remotely using the Internet. I don't know why this isn't a standard part of the operating system.</p>

      <p id="1fdbc6cb-a47c-46af-ba68-88c006a3e388" class="">There are absolutely no conditional statements. For example, to conditionally execute some of the code, one must use a template system (like <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a> for example) over this template system.</p>
      <p id="b5d2815a-eed2-43c7-b88f-f4d0731bda9e" class="">Of course, the definitions of functions (often repeated blocks) and cycles are also missing. If it were anything else, I would probably forgive it, but let's go over a completely practical use case that is really used in our company. We use four environments for each language version of our product and we also use four environments for different stages of the projects: <code>dev</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>stage</code> and <code>prod</code>. First, developers test their deployment on <code>dev</code>, then testers on<code>test</code>, businessmen on <code>stage</code>, and customers eventually use the environment on<code>prod</code>.</p>
      <p id="6b047490-bb40-4bbb-8572-322ac64c367b" class="">When I deploy a new version of the project, it has to go through all these environments. Therefore, it would be good to have some possibility, for example, to run a virtual machine within OpenShift by simply saying "start this four times" on four different environments. Of course, OpenShift does not know how to do this and it has to be done manually. This quickly becomes very large pain because each environment does not differ very much, apart from a little configuration which is the only thing that needs to be dynamically modified.</p>
      <p id="b00a27d5-53f7-4a31-a110-5539848ef094" class="">Do you remember that I originally wrote about different language mutations? Because, there are four instances per language and we currently have four language mutations, which results together in sixteen instances. And, we have projects where there are ten instances per development environment, per language. Thus, 160 instances must be instantiated manually. For one project. And, there is something like twenty projects just for our team.</p>
      <p id="d335de47-8852-40b5-96da-9d3fdf7d283c" class="">It is obvious that this is not possible to manage manually and we were forced to build our own automation in form of python scripts and shellscripts and ansible. I am not happy about it.

      <p id="2118c0a5-796f-4783-b269-5c190be118d0" class="">I think that there was enough of criticism. Let's have a look at some ideas on how to get further.</p>
      <h2 id="2d107031-79d6-4f09-81a7-2523455e055a" class="">Concerning objects</h2>
      <p id="dcfb1cfe-23f3-45ea-890b-e9a2dc9188ae" class="">When I speak about objects, I don't mean things you know from programming languages such as C++, or Java. (Quite a few people are a bit allergic to it as of late.)</p>
      <p id="4c72d251-49f3-43bc-bbb3-890553ff95d4" class="">I mean the general concept of grouping functions with data they operate on. You don't need a <em>class-based approach</em> for that (i.e. you don't have to write classes). You don't even need inheritance, although some form of delegation comes handy.</p>
      <p id="02fb2d93-b1f1-4e12-978f-d9d14469c2f2" class="">The GPIO subdirectory in the <code>/sys</code> filesystem, containing a control file specifying the direction in which data is written (e.g. to or from a LED), and a data file from which you can read or write data to, is an object. It has both a method (the control file) and data which is operated on. Of course, ideally, it'd be possible also to copy and instantiate such an object with the usual means, pass it to other objects and methods, and introspect it. Still, it is a primitive object system where the object is represented by a directory, the data by files, and the methods by control files and operations on them.</p>
      <p id="a27849f2-1406-4e9d-bfd1-433bfb410827" class="">Objects are on the lowest level <em>key-value</em> data. The key causes code execution in case that it is a method name, or otherwise, returns data. The difference between objects and a <em>key-value</em> entry in a database is rather minimal and lies most of all in the ability to store code, as well as in delegation, where, if a key can't be found in a child, the search moves to its parent.</p>
      <p id="a294a5f4-65bd-4004-9bb1-f3066584d972" class="">So, when I speak about objects, I mean generic <em>key-value</em> structures that allow delegation, referencing other <em>key-value</em> structures (objects), reflection, and ideally also some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a>.</p>
      <p id="58046aab-81fb-4fab-a1d4-eebb26762138" class="">I intentionally avoid mentioning any specific language, though I certainly don't mean imperative, object-oriented and structure-based languages such as C++, C#, Java or similar.</p>
      <h1 id="03af910d-457d-4889-b152-3c8f3e4af5a8" class="">Regarding messages</h1>
      <p id="7285a8aa-0dcc-4ddf-ab93-f8339c29e50c" class="">It fascinates me that it isn't a problem to agree on a structured message format on the lowest levels of Internet protocols. Each TCP/IP packet has a clearly defined header, addressing and it all works on an absolutely massive, world-wide scale. So, why shouldn't it work on a computer or between several computers on a higher level as well?</p>
      <p id="6ec4321d-f45b-47ad-9d13-e6031ff1158c" class="">Would it really be a problem to address individual methods of objects or the objects themselves, both within a single computer and on the Internet?</p>

      <p id="777de6f0-a345-4342-b959-05e126ecba2d" class="">I won't be describing any particular system. Even though I've made a few experiments on this topic, I don't have any specific data or experience. I'll just summarize what I've written before. That way, by repeated densening and crystallisation of already analysed thoughts, a compressed-enough description of requirements could arise, so that it could be regarded as a <em>nonconcrete</em> definition of a <em>concrete</em> product.</p>
      <h2 id="8f78c934-11fb-464b-bfa0-fd3ae12dab0a" class="">A database instead of a filesystem</h2>
      <p id="3ba4ca97-1ee6-4dc9-be77-9d43328fe1b7" class="">I thought about it, and, in my opinion, throwing away the filesystem and replacing it with a database is an unavoidable step. When I say a database, I don't mean a specific SQL database, not even <em>key-value</em> "no-SQL" databases. I'm talking here about a generic structured system of storing data on media that supports data types, atomicity, indexing, transactions, journals and storage of arbitrarily structured data, including large blocks of purely binary data.</p>
      <p id="e36a1be4-b43e-41d6-8710-a1492a94d04e" class="">Something where you can just throw an arbitrary structure in and it will take care of saving it <em>without needless serialisation and deserialisation</em>. I realise that it ends up being just a stream of bytes at the end but it's exactly because of this that I can't see many reasons to make any significant difference between what is in the memory and what is on the disk.</p>
      <p id="1b53fcde-595d-45bc-bb64-f333985cce93" class="">I don't want it to look like I've got something against traditional filesystems. I use them just like everyone else but I think that it's impossible to make any significant progress without this. If you can't force a structure on the level of stored data, without constant conversions, from format to format and memory representations, it is like building a house on a swamp - on a foundation that keeps moving.</p>
      <h2 id="c1eebbb7-0649-4d72-b794-d4583994ab13" class="">Programs as collections of addressable code blocks in a database</h2>
      <p id="9b0a75b9-0767-45a1-85a0-571e17db2f35" class="">Once you have a filesystem that allows you to natively store structured information, it stops making sense to keep programs as big continuous series of bytes, walled off from the rest of the world. On the contrary, it makes sense to build something similar to the <em>microservice</em> architecture from it.</p>
      <p id="adf15089-01e3-4e4e-b928-022ba332f0fc" class="">If you think about it in an abstract-enough manner, a program is an object. It is a data collection, operated by functions contained within. It is encapsulated and it communicates only in some standard ways (stdin/out/err, sockets, signals, env, error codes, file writes...). And, if you have a filesystem allowing to store these objects natively, I fail to see any reason not to make the individual <em>methods</em> of this object also accessible from the outside.</p>
      <p id="60036dd2-fde3-4969-b4c4-1a640e88bd84" class="">Once you publish them, you stop having to communicate using the old stream-based methods (sockets, files, ...) - it suffices you to just return structured data.</p>
      <p id="efb802b9-eac3-4c1a-aeaf-77a4de0d16b4" class="">Code can still be compiled and it is still possible to use diverse programming languages. The difference is in the result that falls out of it. Instead of a binary blob sent directly to the CPU and isolated from other processes as well as the rest of the system, what you get is basically a definition of API calls and their outputs. Something like a shared library, only that it's a native element of the system in its final form.</p>
      <h2 id="f23202a2-8e5f-408f-85b5-5abfdba01241" class="">Death of configuration formats and text parsing</h2>
      <p id="877fe390-d181-433f-aca0-4a3cf46590eb" class="">Configuration files and their various formats exist because the filesystem can't save a structure. If it could, you could just save a given object or dictionary, with all its keys and values, and you'd be able to use them directly next time you'd needed them. You now don't have to write string <code>RUN=1</code> in the <code>[configuration]</code> section and then parse it and deserialize it and serialize it again. You could just save the fact that <code>RUN</code> is <code>True</code> to the <code>configuration</code> object.</p>
      <p id="8f6fd2dd-3bfa-42db-8bae-27b66f3a8626" class="">The point that some people don't get is that I am not talking about microsoft registry here, or whatever. You could still use filepaths, but the data you would save on the disc wouldn't be in form of a text, but in form of a structure.</p>
      <p id="2fc0fe45-1f00-4a48-8f3e-658df9800ac0" class="">There is suddenly no need to deal with JSON or CSV, because there is no difference in the format, only in structure. You are not saving text, but the interconnected objects you have in the memory when you work with JSON or CSV after you parsed them.</p>
      <p id="fcd2a163-9802-43c7-89d9-4881c31dbc77" class="">Command line parameters, ENV variables, but also everything else is now described and used as structured data types, using the only language the system understands and uses everywhere.</p>
      <p id="c8d6b142-c558-4294-91aa-b993b9002192" class="">Programs don't parse this as text because the system itself understands the structured description and unpacks it to structures the moment the user finishes typing. Description language is simple in terms of syntax. When a program needs to send data to other program, it doesn't send a serialized version, messages are not sent as stream of bytes, but as structured messages, natively supported by the OS kernel.</p>

        A hierarchical structured database which can keep the data types instead of a filesystem. It contains both programs stored as a collection of each-other calling, as well as outside callable functions, configuration files and user data. All of this in the form of accessible and addressable structures. Simple, for writing and reading <strong>lightweight</strong> text format used wherever user input encodes some kind of structure. Programs that do not use text protocols to communicate but exchange structures directly.

        So what would be a better way to solve this?<br>
        <br>
        We can reimagine the whole thing. Probably the most interesting take on this is the monad manifesto. The problem with monad is that it doesn't go far enough. But they do hit on a key thing: files and streams was a great metaphor to describe most compute work in the 60s, and for a while it was the best there was. But around the same time a more solid idea was forming, though it wouldn't evolve into it's full potential until the 70s: Objects (in the smalltalk sense, not simula).<br>
        <br>
        So lets revisit the OS, and the file system. So the idea is simple: everything in the OS is an isolated, completely obtuse "thing" we call this objects. And everything is an object, from the CPU running your code, to the kernel, to its scheduler, to the data you transfer outside. Your program itself is an object, though it's hidden internally. Generally objects don't expose their internals, instead you pass a message to them. The message may itself contain an object, to which the receiving object may then send another message with its internals. Objects sending and receiving of messages are not guaranteed to be in series, though some may.<br>
        <br>
        So thinking of reading a piece of data from, say your keyboard or another process in a pipe you'd send it an object which can handle receive a piece of data (the reading as a series of bytes), if you are thinking call-back you pretty much got it. Now you can send a separate thing, or you can send a continuation to yourself, so your program pauses until the bytes are available, at which point the callback writes them into a buffer and the jumps to the continuation letting your program proceed. It isn't that far from how OSes work now, but the model and metaphor fully describes it and makes it obvious this is the way to go, instead of it seemingly doing weird things. Async is inherent in the model.<br>
        <br>
        The advantage is that objects may appear to be the same, but behind the scenes expose very different things. And some objects may expose various things. Say writing as a transnational operation. You send a message to a writable data object which returns to you a transaction generator, when you send a message it returns (through continuations again) a result of writing to the transaction (which itself should be committed separately). If you don't want transactions (for whatever reason) or they don't make sense (writing to an append only object, like audio out) you have a simpler interface where you simply send the write operations to the object directly, no transaction.<br>
        Now of course this leads to an interesting challenge. In Unix everything is a string, which allows things to interact. But objects aren't guaranteed to be uniform.<br>
        <br>
        The whole point of using objects instead of streams is that objects are more flexible (and honest) on what they are! The solution is that you can always try to find which interfaces an object implements. Here we can have a lot of discussion, but the solution is mostly set really. You can define interfaces, which are simply promises of what kind of messages an object can receive and send, and what guarantees it has (or at least must have). Objects can implement interfaces themselves, having full access to their internal, external implementation of interfaces can be done (using the object only on its external form, through its defined interfaces) and you can do implicit interfaces which are duck typing. You can then tell an object to pass itself to one object (generally a continuation) if it fulfills an interface, or to another (generally an error handler) if it doesn't. This allows for most basic type systems. Again the shell may give you a nicer way of describing this, but to the OS this is basically what it is.<br>
        <br>
        Resource management, dealing with open resources, etc. is handled by a GC, which works as you'd expect it.<br>
        <br>
        When objects pass their own stuff to others, they pass the necessary permissions, so security is bound to this. Commands by a user generally start with the permissions the user gives that command (generally open enough to not be annoying) and they may limit what they pass to other objects. Basically instead of file permission, we have object permission (modify, read, send messages to other objects aka. execute, etc.) and they can limit the scope (though not enlarge it) as needed. Because objects are more flexible than files you get more power.<br>
        <br>
        And now how to get specific objects. One is through resources, these are objects that are well defined and understood, and generally identified through a URI (or IRI if we're being modern). Basically files and the URI is the filepath. Again shells can do good conventions to make it faster (just like you don't need to specify http(s) or www in browsers). Of course some objects can build their own namespace (basically do the same thing as a folder) which allows them to access their resources, others can access those resources through them (so /bin/ed is our editor, but /bin/ed/conf.toml is the editor's default configuration). Resources are not specifically tied to any one thing, but may have multiple paths to it. Having path in the resource system to a resource generally keeps it alive. Not all objects can become resources (think a resource handle which makes no sense to access out of context) but generally they can.<br>
        <br>
        The second is providers, which are commonly accessible objects (either as a resource, or maybe provided by providers) that give you access to objects that do certain specific functionality. Generally the most common provider would be the environment provider, which gives you whatever is true for your environment (access to file, resources and so forth). A container system would basically expose what resources you have through env. Another would be context, which is more like what the specific process knows about how it was run (like which directory it was called from, what permissions were passed on to the object, etc). Basically DI at OS level.<br>
        <br>
        Then we revisit the whole pattern of how we code things. Generally instead of building a full program, we build a series of programs that work well together. The most fundamental program would be one that lets programs work together. So if I were doing vi, it would be a system that loads a view, and a key-press mapper (we don't use the standard ttl of course). The view shows a buffer, which is an object that lets me do arbitrary selections and actions. Most transformations would be done through a visitor-like pattern, it the visitor actually may output a transformation, and allows it to work more like recursive schemes. The viewer doesn't use a raw-buffer, but instead one wraps the data, but allows arbitrary style information added on a second layer. My loading script will actually add extra layers, realizing when it's code, or such allowing me further functionality and more rich view. The loading script also loads a bunch of keyboard bindings, which bind to specific objects/visitors/transformers which do actions. So I could start a select-search command, which selects all pieces of text that fullfill a regex, and then a replace command, which replaces those selections with whatever text I input. If it's code I could automatically load another searcher which uses the same command for all languages, the semantic searcher which lets me do things like select all directly named instances of this variable/function but ultimately just changes whatever the selection of the buffer is. I can then do the same replace or such.<br>
        <br>
        Basically the Unix philosophy got to its limits because computers started doing all sorts of things that the original model never considered. It lost it's structure and philosophy as it adapted and exceptions became more common than the rule, and decisions that now weren't the best one had to be kept to not loose existing features. But nowadays we have a better system to solve it, one that has proven it self time and time again. I think it would be interesting to build an OS that was like this from the beginning. Unix-like scenarios could be allowed, as Unix is simply a special case of the model.

        OK, bro. Show us how to send a "message" over the wire without serializing it to a stream of bytes, then bits, then physical encoding first.

      <p id="a4f295c5-378f-4118-bf9f-212d61fb351b" class=""><em>Sigh</em>. You are missing the point and see stuff that is literally not there. Of course that on some level, there will always be some kind of lowlevel representation. But YOU don't need to do that, in a same way you don't need to create electric impulses in the ethernet cable you are using to connect to internet. You use a layers of abstractions, which do that for you.</p>
      <p id="38006901-548f-4566-bbab-d85a6dee6dfa" class="">In a same way, <strong>you</strong> don't really <em>need</em> to send a bytes via sockets, you can use some kind of abstraction to do that for your. For example, I regularly use zeromq in python to send whole objects between different processes and systems, without caring about the representation.</p>
      <p id="99675ae9-84a4-4e2c-85ef-0aeb5ebc4333" class="">Second point I was trying to make is that there is a difference between serializing that message yourself, like for example when you want to send a document, so you use an library to serialize that document into the .doc, or .odt or whatever. You may use a library, or maybe you have your own description of a protocol of raw bytes ordered by a certain schema. Or maybe you use XML. <strong>You are basically compiling the data you had in memory into some kind of structure, that is very different from the data you had in your memory.</strong></p>
      <p id="eb6d99ee-fd39-4e91-bef5-f8b9474b86cd" class="">Someone else must then use other parser implemented by some specification or maybe RFC. This other <em>codec</em> creates some kind of representation in memory, which may be very different from what the representation in you system was.</p>
      <p id="b0aaf397-7e48-45bd-aba4-a6d92d75a52b" class="">Now, there is a second way, you may be familiar with, if you are a programmer yourself; you just send a state of your objects, automatically encoded by some lowlevel serialization protocol for interoperability. For example, you may just dump the state of the object tree in your memory to JSON, or even better, use something like <a href="https://msgpack.org/">messagepack</a>, <a href="https://capnproto.org/">cap'n proto</a> or <a href="https://github.com/google/flatbuffers">flatbuffers</a>. Recipient then doesn't have any other codec beyond this primitive lowlevel deserialization library. He doesn't need to really understand how the document is structured, because he receives the structure as a whole, without the need to parse it.</p>
      <p id="ab2ac896-4872-45bb-b69a-9f3b8fdcc073" class="">Analogy would be, that he doesn't really need a .doc parser, because all he needs is a JSON parser, for everything he uses, because everything is JSON. But JSON is not a good analogy, because it actually is lowlevel JavaScript format never meant for serious data representation, so it doesn't really have a schema and metaobject protocol, so you can't really reconstruct the whole object tree in memory. With the system I am talking about, you could transfer the structure AND a description of the object, which you could use to automatically generate a tree of objects in memory, in every language from the description of the objects (similarly to how you can use for example XML-RPC metadata to generate a client, or maybe Swagger metadata to generate client code for whatever language you are using).</p>
      <p id="7fc85c4c-d731-4943-8932-307f920685a1" class="">This may seem like a security nightmare, but there are ways how to do this, best of which I think is probably <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286619645_Korz_Simple_Symmetric_Subjective_Context-Oriented_Programming">Korz</a>.</p>
