      <blockquote id="8ef93691-b8e3-4849-8da5-17b90a79a5a8" class="">
        I majored in Aerospace Engineering. To solve questions, I used logical thinking, equations, and first principles.

      <blockquote id="8b524f36-ba9e-401b-85b9-454461c9777d" class="">
        I thought everything could be solved this way. After all, it’s not rocket science.

      <blockquote id="05826dd3-f335-402f-b082-e9d33cf6af46" class="">
        When I exercised it was to the tune of an excel spreadsheet, meticulously planned and based on Soviet weightlifting textbooks. When I studied Japanese, I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> software to perfectly match flashcards with my ‘forgetting curve’.

        I started to notice problems that wouldn’t go away, no matter how hard I logiced them.

      <blockquote id="b70cdf12-02f4-40f6-90da-a0db62672633" class="">
        I thought my failures were from a lack of rationality. That project I procrastinated on? A flaw in my systems. Those weird emotions? Cognitive biases that needed to be removed.

      <blockquote id="9eae0b17-b99b-4f82-860e-7df344b6cc31" class="">
        I tried to logic my emotional problems away. I stuffed mental models into my head and read papers on the most effective treatments. But my conflict avoidance, my shyness, and my sense of unease all refused to be stuffed-down with reason.

      <p id="57824030-9ce1-4176-a2ee-b5ea5d580c5e" class="">From what I've read in the blogpost, the author did a classic mistake; he considered rationality to be just logic and thinking. In short, what is sometimes called "<em>Hollywood rationality</em>". In the words of Yudkowsky, one of the <em>rationality</em> speakers and proponents:</p>
      <blockquote id="dc71a84c-b0df-42b8-a697-3e07041443d5" class="">
        In a Hollywood movie, being “rational” usually means that you’re a stern, hyperintellectual stoic. Think Spock from <em>Star Trek</em>, who “rationally” suppresses his emotions, “rationally” refuses to rely on intuitions or impulses, and is easily dumbfounded and outmaneuvered upon encountering an erratic or “irrational” opponent.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote id="c3fe0db5-1c6f-4865-8af2-c59e05ca0925" class="">
        There’s a completely different notion of “rationality” studied by mathematicians, psychologists, and social scientists. Roughly, it’s the idea of <em>doing the best you can with what you’ve got</em>. A rational person, no matter how out of their depth they are, forms the best beliefs they can with the evidence they’ve got. A rational person, no matter how terrible a situation they’re stuck in, makes the best choices they can to improve their odds of success.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote id="8c7b222e-5ab5-4f0e-a21a-8cd46f7cfdc4" class="">
        Real-world rationality isn’t about ignoring your emotions and intuitions. For a human, rationality often means becoming more self-aware about your feelings, so you can factor them into your decisions.

      <p id="63b83e3d-8354-4a73-890f-2430907c464c" class="">Rationality, as far as I know it, and also how it is described for example by the Yudkowsky, whom the author links in his blog, is <em>a tool for the mind</em>. In the <a href="https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/">Rationality: From AI to Zombies</a>, Yudkowsky elaborates:</p>

        When you open your eyes and look at the room around you, you’ll locate your laptop in relation to the table, and you’ll locate a bookcase in relation to the wall. If something goes wrong with your eyes, or your brain, then your mental model might say there’s a bookcase where no bookcase exists, and when you go over to get a book, you’ll be disappointed.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote id="6742f85a-8d58-40dd-9ddb-05d7f759bc1f" class="">
        This is what it’s like to have a false belief, a map of the world that doesn’t correspond to the territory. Epistemic rationality is about building accurate maps instead. This correspondence between belief and reality is commonly called “truth,” and I’m happy to call it that.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote id="be7ae507-3e1d-459a-8119-3d988dde3add" class="">
        Instrumental rationality, on the other hand, is about <em>steering</em> reality—sending the future where you want it to go. It’s the art of choosing actions that lead to outcomes ranked higher in your preferences. I sometimes call this “winning.”

It tells you that your <em>wetware</em>, guided by the no longer relevant evolutionary psychology, is trying to do a stupid thing. It's like math; it can be useful and it can show you the world as it is, and the mistakes in your thinking. But you don't want to make yourself into the human equivalent of electronic calculator.</p>

        Through much trial and error, I learned that there are non-systemic, non-rational tools available to explore. Amongst the sea of ‘woo’ nonsense there were real, applicable ideas. They weren’t always easy to learn, and they took work to use.
