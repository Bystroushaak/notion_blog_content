      <p id="9f7996e7-44d9-475f-94be-01cf9119fa35" class="">My life seems to be moving in strange waves of productivity. I've spent several days by creating 3D models, then by programming and then by writing. But I can't just switch context and mix it, to do for example a bit of programming and a bit of 3D modelling. It just comes and goes with waves of inspiration and inner motivation. Weird.</p>

      <p id="bbb107f2-f793-4f7c-943a-6c53fa6a9ead" class="">I would like to return to the development, but I can't find the motivation. I still think about rewriting it to <em>something else</em>. Maybe java (graalvm), maybe rust, or nim.</p>
      <p id="d02e9596-9d0e-45c0-8850-15969f67133d" class="">One of the reasons is rpython (python to C translation and compilation toolkit), of which I am tired lately. Second reason is that I think that the architecture is wrong in some specific details, but I am not sure how to do it better. It works, but it is slow and really really hard to debug. I would also like to add some kind of GUI, but rpython offers no support beyond "C ffi". Which sux.</p>
      <h1 id="ab40aeac-e321-4199-88d8-defb21f2292b" class="">Object wiki update</h1>
      <p id="21b5b58b-0c2a-4349-9f71-782ac1e27680" class="">objWiki, on the other hand, is receiving a steady flow of commits. I've refactored a lot of unclear code, added a internal documentation to (private) objWiki notion page. The goal was to lower the cognitive load of the PyQt code as much as possible.</p>

      <p id="2ef59101-189d-4714-80fe-ca304285c57e" class="">I've added a lot of internal features and improvements. One of the most visible new feature is the support for headers.</p>
      <figure id="00c02ff8-5ebf-46c0-b80d-1d34ff552ea0" class="image">

      <p id="8051280b-1a07-4d71-b3f6-10d5cd4a4eab" class="">The toolbars change dynamically, right now you can see the toolbar for the header, which offers you all kind of structural transformations (to the normal text, or other header sizes).</p>
      <p id="ca6a226d-bdfb-4ade-b147-25b5eaab101f" class="">At the moment, I am working on the core editation functionality. Context menu that will allow you to transform, duplicate or delete every input object in the node. Internal command line. Joining of two inputs, support for the undo across multiple inlined widgets and so on.</p>
      <p id="2de0cca9-0ceb-4afd-9975-d1f36c458bda" class="">This is still in the infancy, but when it is done, adding new features, like inlined images, or any kind of widgets, should be really quick and simple. The hardest part is to make PyQt work with the rest of the system. This takes most of my time at the moment.</p>
      <h1 id="9bdc7242-2945-41a9-acf5-5de6e916743c" class="">/r/cyberDeck business</h1>
      <p id="c252ca54-8fb6-4605-81ee-373b7ddc1a21" class="">I've created the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/">/r/cyberDeck</a> subreddit more than four years ago (<time>@2016/02/13</time>). You can read the article <a href="../Hardware/Cyberdecks.html" title="Cyberdecks">Cyberdecks</a> to see what I've had in mind; <em>diy headless computers</em>, that use <em>head mounted displays</em> (think Oculus) as a primary output device.</p>
      <p id="2866715f-d086-4d64-a71e-6a301db0782f" class="">For example, the founder of the Oculus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Luckey">Palmer Luckey</a> <a href="http://palmerluckey.com/oculus-goblack-how-to-make-your-oculus-go-better/">has built himself</a> a computer in keyboard, that wirelessly connectes to his Oculus Go. I was at a time really interested in the 3D environments, so I've also created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HMDprogramming/">/r/HMDProgramming</a>, a subreddit about programming <em>inside</em> 3D environments.</p>
      <p id="4266100b-72bd-47b6-915f-9fa22c1cc097" class="">I've filled /r/cyberDeck with all resources that were available to me at the time. I was interested in inspiration, howtos, experiences with building your own "GPU heavy" device and about a software you would use.</p>
      <p id="6f28e2e1-6f4d-4a37-b219-f64be66144f5" class="">Instead, it got plagued by cyberpunkish aesthetics and all kinds of diy computer builds. People just posted whatever looked like "cyberdeck" to them, even to the point of just posting stuff like rPI with usb keyboards, lying on the table in mess of wires, because it looked "raw" enough. Worst of all, almost no one cared about <em>head mounted displays</em>.</p>
      <p id="f9f64afa-d94b-46b5-ae41-9e46a8b61aef" class="">I've chosen the word "cyberdeck" specifically because it has a meaning, defined by the early cyberpunk and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> novels. I knew that it would resonate with the people, but as it turned out, it resonated too much.</p>
      <p id="c6c24dc8-a857-4cd8-86e5-f06e0503c623" class="">At first, I fought against the trend, but when the number of subscribers raised to several thousands, I've decided to let it live its own life. Now it has more than nineteen thousand people happily sharing their builds. It is a nice sub, full of enthusiastic people who love their idea of "cyberdeck".</p>

      <p id="147ee159-a1ef-49b3-aab5-81ef796f1f04" class="">So, as of <time>@2020/08/29</time>, I've released myself from the "ownership" of the sub, because it no longer fits my needs. The guy called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Talulabelle/">Talulabelle</a> is moderator for more than a year now, and I guess he is more than competent to take care of it. Or not. I don't really care.</p>

      <p id="189c58fb-a663-4801-8cc4-8fdd0d2a7702" class="">I did a lot of improvements to the blog. Most notable is that I've turned the ads off.</p>
      <h2 id="9bde0953-a1f7-4552-86d2-418f4c811b3d" class="">Unrolling the sections</h2>
      <p id="7c33b990-58ee-438d-b5fe-5da21ad6d817" class="">Root sections were historically just one page with a bunch of headers, under which the articles in that "section" were listed.</p>

      </figure>
      <p id="a4a43da7-7b43-4946-b43d-b7a9b0214f82" class="">Now I've changed the way how it works and looks into something much more readable:</p>

      </figure>
      <p id="5274249e-b357-41a6-9402-e40fabd5d206" class="">As you can see, each article now has description visible. Categories with a lot of articles still hide most of the older ones, but by default offer more space for the previews. Each article that has metadata with time shows it next to the name of the article, with the information about number of subpages and when it was updated.</p>
      <p id="2a696769-76cc-449a-9cc4-db2a490e3bd6" class="">You can see a lot of toplevel categories in the right menu. My theory is that this should increase the time users spend on the blog. What you can't see is also a list of tags and the list of pages that refer to this page, both of which I've added to articles (this is a category page, so thats why you don't see it).</p>
      <p id="b1b6fd8c-a4a7-4078-9e27-165851cc5c71" class="">One of the hidden features is that I've added a lot more metadata to describe each page. I've added so much, that I've had to create internal documentation page just to keep track.</p>
      <p id="ed5326cd-88f9-47e5-9229-24fac5e8f4ee" class="">More interesting metadata:</p>

      <p id="4f5712da-0488-4880-8cc2-09adfaf9e1c9" class="">My life/work ballance is a shitshow. Six months on the homeoffice caused that I've lost track of what is work and what not. I am sitting in front of the same LCD and keyboard all day long.</p>
      <p id="05348042-7ea0-4200-b24b-f0ee9831ce0c" class="">On top of that, the company where I work is preparing to replace thousands of systems in the Romania with our own implementation that already successfully runs in the Czech, Slovak, and Polish language mutations.</p>
      <p id="d72b905a-6eda-44c9-a5f2-32036a7564f4" class="">There is huge rush to fix all bugs, some of which are not even in software, but caused by changing legislation and business requirements.</p>
      <p id="b7cda97e-dced-4e7f-b9a0-813c9805bf48" class="">I've redone some pieces of the software I am working on five times and it is still not done. Needless to say, this is not good for moral.</p>
      <p id="34ec8a9b-c49b-4df2-891f-b27f3e7a8b3b" class="">And just for things to be more interesting, some of the guys from the Romania have no idea what they are doing. Literally bunch of windows only webdevs tasked with python/linux/packaging job. I've tried to help them as much as I could, but it was complicated and strange story. So much that my friend suggested that I should write it down. I am working on that.</p>

      <p id="519a88a3-0b90-4b68-acb3-cefc36ce3fc4" class="">My life kinda sux. I've had more fights with my girlfriend, and we are not talking with each other at the moment, most probably also for the next three weeks (as per agreement), and quite probably not ever. Fights, breakups. All kind of nasty crap.</p>
      <p id="bd3c4cd2-db9c-4e42-b719-f50649daff70" class="">On the completely different topic, I've visited my brother at the mental hospital in the south of the country. He is locked there now and then, because he suffers from the paranoid schizophrenia. He was quite slow, because of all the medication he takes. But he was happy that I've come and took daughter and gf with me. He thinks about getting married with his gf, which is nice I guess.</p>

Since children here are going to the schools, I expect lockdowns of pretty much everything in two to three weeks, when the effect of spread among them propagates to their parents. So far, the numbers here make record every day. The government is issuing new restrictions every day, in a way that makes no sense and speaks of immense misunderstanding and mess.</p>
      <p id="41f6a0bb-a2aa-46d8-8106-4e14d05f3e89" class="">I also feel kinda bored with my life. Maybe the coronavirus situation is getting to me. I am bored by my job, bored by my lifestyle. I can't help to be somehow drawn to big machinery. Ships. Shipyards. Offshore sea wind turbines. Also, all kinds of military hardware. I think about realigning my life with some of this stuff again and again.</p>

Then I've thought about how I would write something like this, and I concluded that it is actually done quite right, and it also became more interesting in time, so I've enjoyed the rest.</p>

      <blockquote id="47d122a0-0540-4342-ae43-6af6ccf13c45" class="">
        Prador resemble extremely large crabs. The body is covered by a flattened, pear-shaped shell with scalloped rims. The wide front end of the body bears several pairs of small red eyes, including one pair on movable stalks. They walk on six insectoid legs, each ending in a large spike. Adult Prador shed the hindmost pair of legs and lose the ability to regrow lost limbs. Hanging from the underside of the body are four small manipulator arms ending in clusters of fingers and hooks serving as hands. Positioned above these are huge crab-like working claws, used mainly for combat and heavy labor. Prador mouths are sets of grasping, shearing mandibles suited for eating meat.

I've had a Jornada 720 in the 2010s and I've used it to write my first blogposts at <a href="http://abclinuxu.cz">abclinuxu.cz</a>. So I've decided to buy old Jornada 720 (only 32 megs of RAM) as an experimental Emacs terminal. They are quite cheap, so it is great testing device before you buy something pricier. I wanted to see how big it is, and whether I can touch type on it.</p>
